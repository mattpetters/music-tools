# Music Tools

This repo is a collection of scripts I wrote to help install music plugins faster (ie; when getting a new computer). Setting up DAW environments is a pain in the ass and takes forever so this at least automates the install and patching of your plugins.

## Usage

```
./install_pkgs.sh <path to directory with pkg files in it>

./run_patchers.sh <path to directory with .command files in it>
```
